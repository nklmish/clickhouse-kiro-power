# ClickHouse Kiro Power

A [Kiro](https://kiro.dev) power that connects your IDE directly to [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com) databases. Query data, explore schemas, and get best-practice guidance for schema design, query optimization, and data ingestion — all through natural language in your editor.

## What It Does

This power gives Kiro the ability to talk to your ClickHouse databases via the [ClickHouse MCP Server](https://github.com/ClickHouse/mcp-clickhouse). Instead of switching between your IDE and a SQL console, you can ask Kiro things like:

- "Show me the top 10 slowest queries in the last hour"
- "What tables are in my analytics database?"
- "Is my ORDER BY optimal for this query pattern?"
- "How many parts does my events table have?"

Kiro will run the right SQL, interpret the results, and give you actionable advice grounded in [28 best-practice rules](#whats-included) for ClickHouse.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev) installed
- A ClickHouse database (Cloud, self-hosted, or the public SQL Playground)

### 1. Install the Power

Open Kiro and install the **ClickHouse Database** power from the Powers panel.

### 2. Connect to ClickHouse

**ClickHouse Cloud (recommended):**

1. Log in to your [ClickHouse Cloud console](https://clickhouse.com/cloud)
2. Select your service → click **Connect** → enable **Remote MCP Server**
3. The power connects automatically via OAuth — authenticate in your browser when prompted

The default `mcp.json` config is already set up:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clickhouse": {
      "url": "https://mcp.clickhouse.cloud/mcp",
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

**Self-hosted ClickHouse:**

Replace `mcp.json` with the open-source MCP server config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clickhouse": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--with", "mcp-clickhouse", "--python", "3.10", "mcp-clickhouse"],
      "env": {
        "CLICKHOUSE_HOST": "<your-host>",
        "CLICKHOUSE_PORT": "8443",
        "CLICKHOUSE_USER": "<your-user>",
        "CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD": "<your-password>",
        "CLICKHOUSE_SECURE": "true",
        "CLICKHOUSE_VERIFY": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to be installed.

**Just want to try it out?** Use the public SQL Playground — no credentials needed:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clickhouse": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--with", "mcp-clickhouse", "--python", "3.10", "mcp-clickhouse"],
      "env": {
        "CLICKHOUSE_HOST": "sql-clickhouse.clickhouse.com",
        "CLICKHOUSE_PORT": "8443",
        "CLICKHOUSE_USER": "demo",
        "CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD": "",
        "CLICKHOUSE_SECURE": "true",
        "CLICKHOUSE_VERIFY": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Start Querying

Open Kiro chat and ask away:

```
> "List all databases on my service"
> "Show me the schema for the events table"
> "What's the average duration by event type in the last 24 hours?"
```

## What's Included

### MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `run_select_query` | Execute read-only SQL queries |
| `list_databases` | Discover all databases on a service |
| `list_tables` | Browse tables with full schema details |
| `get_organizations` | List your ClickHouse Cloud organizations |
| `get_services_list` | List services in an organization |
| `get_service_details` | Inspect service config and status |
| `list_clickpipes` | View configured ClickPipes |
| `list_service_backups` | Check backup history |
| `get_organization_cost` | Review billing and usage data |

### Steering: 28 Best-Practice Rules

The power ships with a comprehensive steering file that Kiro uses automatically when helping with ClickHouse work. It covers:

**Schema Design (Critical)**
- Plan ORDER BY before table creation (it's immutable)
- Order columns low-to-high cardinality for effective index pruning
- Use native types (UInt32, DateTime, UUID) instead of String
- Use `LowCardinality(String)` for columns with < 10K unique values
- Avoid `Nullable` unless semantically required

**Query Optimization (Critical)**
- Choose the right JOIN algorithm for your data sizes
- Filter tables before joining, not after
- Use data skipping indices (bloom_filter, set, minmax) for non-ORDER BY filters
- Use materialized views for real-time pre-aggregation

**Insert Strategy (Critical)**
- Batch inserts at 10K–100K rows per INSERT
- Use async inserts for high-frequency small batches
- Use ReplacingMergeTree instead of ALTER TABLE UPDATE
- Avoid OPTIMIZE TABLE FINAL — let background merges work

**Partitioning (High)**
- Keep partition cardinality low (100–1,000 values)
- Use partitioning for data lifecycle, not query optimization
- Start without partitioning and add it when needed

## Example Session

Here's what a typical interaction looks like:

```
You:  "What tables do I have in the default database?"
Kiro: Runs list_tables → shows table names, engines, row counts, and sizes

You:  "How's the part health on my events table?"
Kiro: Queries system.parts → shows partition breakdown with part counts and disk usage

You:  "I'm designing a new table for user activity tracking.
       Most queries filter by user_id and date range."
Kiro: Suggests ORDER BY (user_id, toDate(timestamp)) with LowCardinality
       for status columns, proper data types, and explains the reasoning
       using the steering best practices
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "MCP server not connected" | Reconnect from Kiro's MCP panel (Cmd+Shift+P → search "MCP") |
| "Authentication failed" | Re-authenticate via browser; verify MCP is enabled in Cloud console |
| Service is idle/sleeping | Wake the service from ClickHouse Cloud console, then retry |
| "Too many parts" error | Increase batch size to 10K+ rows; check partition cardinality |
| Slow queries | Verify filters align with ORDER BY; use `EXPLAIN indexes = 1` |
